					<blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence">
						 All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible.
